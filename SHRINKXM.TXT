■ History
  Version   Release Note

      1.0   First public release
      1.1   Fixed a text strings.
            Fixed a bug that caused SHRINKXM to wrap some samples in patches.
            Thanks to Dagoon Autumn for pointing that out to me.
            Now with wildcard support, so you can optimize 
            all or some of the files in a directory that you decide.
      1.2   Recompiled to get rid of the Pentium bug (runtime error 200)

■ Introduction

  This utility gives you the ability to optimize FAST TRACKER XM modules.
  You can remove unused patterns, samples and clip looped samples. All this
  and still keeping the original descriptions written in the samplenames.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  NOTICE : If you get the message 'out of memory' and you have more than
           300K free, it might be because the XM file isn't packed. To solve
           this problem, please load the XM into Fast Tracker II, save it and
           try SHRINKXM on it again. If this dosn't help, free up some memory.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

■ Disclaimer
  This software has been tested and found to work properly. OBSESSiON have no
  responsbility whatsoever for any damages caused by use, or misuse of this
  software.

  IF YOU DISAGREE WITH ANY OF THOSE TERMS, PLEASE REMOVE THIS SOFTWARE NOW.

■ How to register
  If you, after a 30 days test period, wish to continue using this software,
  you NEED to send me a postcard with your name and address or register at our
  homepage at HTTP://WWW.CYBERNET.DK/USERS/BUGSY. The reason is that it's the
  ONLY way I can explain to my wife why I have invested MORE than 90 hours
  developing this software. This is the only way I can see that someone is
  really using this software. If I don't receive anything by mail, I won't
  update the program no more.

  This means :
    IF NOT (ReceivedAnyPostCardOrEMail) THEN
      HALT (Programmer)
    ELSE
      ReleaseNextVersion

■ Program documentation

  To optimize an XM module just type :
    SHRINKXM.EXE xmfilename [optional parameters]

  Like this :
    SHRINKXM.EXE jz-oft3.xm

  or if you wish to optimize all XM files beginning with "jz-" :
    SHRINKXM.EXE jz-*.xm

  If you start SHRINKXM without any (or valid) parameters, you will see a
  help screen like this :

    USAGE : SHRINKXM.EXE infile.xm outfile.xm [-NP] [-NS] [-NSL] [-NB]

    -NP  Do NOT remove unused patterns
    -NS  Do NOT remove unused samples
    -NSL Do NOT clip at end of sampleloops
    -NB  Do NOT make any backup files

    Wildcards are allowed in the xmfilename.
    Like : SHRINKXM.EXE jz-*.xm

  By default SHRINKXM optimizes patterns, samples, sampleloops and
  make backup files (with the extention .BAK).
